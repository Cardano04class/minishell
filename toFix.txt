[ DONE ] - check heredoc expand.waiting amirs expand to work on it

[ DONE ] - check exit status working but still need some test cases :
        * fixing exit with any numeric value (exit 12, per example).
        * the exit status should be checked also for the Builtins and syntax_error. 
                (both * for amine).

[ DONE ] - and still need to check the case of $ expand of variable that doesnt exits and have nothing it. 
        when writing in the prompt it return a white spaces to the t_lt list, and nedds to be freed instead of returning a white space to parser .

[ DONE ] - Norminette.

- Checking allocations like this to see if there rightly allocated : "g_mini.command = _malloc(sizeof(t_cmd), 'm');".

- ***for amir*** : 
        + check ft_strdup.c, why commenting NULL protection ?
        + reahab.c ? ach had l9lawi.
        + expand nominette!
        + main Norminette, chderna fiha ?
